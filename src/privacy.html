          If you are a resident of California, you have the right to request to
          Eventpipe what personal information has been collected about you, and to
          access that information. You also have the right to request deletion of
          your personal information, though exceptions under the CCPA may allow
          Eventpipe to retain and use certain personal information notwithstanding
          your deletion request. We will not discriminate against you for
